# 👋 Hi, I’m Rico (@ricostap)

🌱 I’m currently learning about Github, Hugo and the hugoplate template. Love Hugo a lot, I am used to wordpress, elementor and other builders and themes and was always taken back by the bloat. Hogo is like a breeze of fresh air :) Hugoplate is quite complex and not much documentation is available so any pointers on how to learn this fast are appreciated.

## My other interests 💞️ are:
- FOSS
- Linux (Debian and Fedora)
- NextCloud
- Odoo
- Yachting
- The Beach

📫 You can reach me on ricosta@gmail.com

⚡ Fun fact: I live in Samui and Phuket,Thailand for the last 37 years and I am still loving it.

Hope this is a nice community and I'll find ways to contribute soon.
